        <hr />
        <p> Human behavior alludes to the variety of each physical activity and perceptible feeling related with people
            and as well as human being. While particular characteristics of one's identity and actions can be steadier,
            different behaviours will change as one moe from birth through adulthood. Understanding the human behaviour
            has been specifically compelling to researchers for a long period of time, Additionally, the presumption
            that deeper knowledge of attitudes , will help in task of predicting human behavior has fashioned the reason
            for many clients and social research.</p>
